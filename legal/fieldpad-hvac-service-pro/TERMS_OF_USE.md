## 1. Subscription Terms

### 1.1 Free Tier

FieldPad offers a free tier with the following usage limits:

| Feature | Free Limit |
|---------|-----------|
| Clients | 5 |
| Jobs | 10 |
| Invoices | 10 |
| Estimates | 5 |
| Compliance Logs | 20 |
| Cylinders | 10 |
| A2L Compliance Logs | 5 |
| Invoice Shares | 5 (lifetime) |
| Estimate Shares | 10 (lifetime) |
| PDF Invoice Generation | 8 (lifetime) |
| OCR Cylinder Scans | 15 (lifetime) |

### 1.2 FieldPad Pro Subscription

FieldPad Pro removes all count limits and unlocks additional features:
- Unlimited clients, jobs, invoices, estimates, compliance logs, and cylinders
- Unlimited invoice and estimate sharing
- Unlimited PDF generation and OCR scanning
- Data export (JSON/CSV)
- EPA compliance log export
- Recurring job scheduling
- Business logo on invoices
- Full digital signature images on PDFs (no watermark)

**Note**: iCloud sync runs automatically for all users via SwiftData+CloudKit — your data syncs to your private iCloud container regardless of subscription tier. FieldPad Pro unlocks Sync Status & Controls (sync status monitoring, last synced timestamp, and manual sync trigger), which provide visibility into sync activity but do not affect the underlying sync behavior.

### 1.3 Billing

- Subscriptions are billed through Apple's App Store
- Subscription auto-renews unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period
- Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase
- Subscription management and cancellation are handled through your App Store account settings

### 1.4 Refunds

Refund requests must be directed to Apple per App Store policies.

## 2. Free Tier Behavior

- Count-limited features display usage progress and block new record creation when limits are reached
- Pro-only features (data export, compliance log export, recurring jobs, business logo) are unavailable on the free tier
- Free users' invoice PDFs display watermark text where signatures would appear on Pro PDFs
- All locally stored data remains accessible regardless of subscription status — downgrading does not delete your data
- Existing records beyond free limits remain viewable and editable; only creation of new records beyond the limit is blocked

### 2.1 Subscription Expiry

If your Pro subscription expires or is cancelled:
- **All existing data is preserved** — no records are deleted
- **Read and edit access**: You can continue to view and edit all existing records, including those beyond free tier limits
- **Creation limits re-enforced**: New record creation is subject to free tier limits
- **Pro-only features locked**: Data export, compliance log export, recurring job creation, and business logo features require re-subscription
- **In-progress operations**: If a Pro feature is actively in use when the subscription expires, the current operation completes normally; subsequent attempts will prompt for re-subscription

## 3. EPA Data Accuracy and Compliance Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT — PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

### 3.1 Record-Keeping Tool Only

FieldPad is a **record-keeping and calculation tool**. It is **not** a substitute for professional legal, regulatory, or compliance advice. The App does not certify, guarantee, or verify EPA compliance.

### 3.2 User Responsibility for Data Entry

**All compliance data is manually entered by you.** The App performs calculations based on the data you provide but does not independently verify the accuracy of your input. Specifically:

- Refrigerant weights (pounds recovered, recharged) are entered by you
- Equipment charge amounts and specifications are entered by you
- Leak test results and repair records are entered by you
- Technician certification information is entered by you

**You are solely responsible for the accuracy of all data entered into the App.**

### 3.3 Leak Rate Calculations

The App calculates leak rates using EPA Section 608 and AIM Act Subpart C formulas applied to data you manually enter. These calculations:

- Are performed **on-demand** when you log a recharge event — they are **not** real-time sensor-based monitoring
- Use Method 1 (annualized) or Method 2 (screening) formulas as defined by EPA regulations
- Compare results against applicable EPA thresholds (e.g., 20% for commercial refrigeration; 15% for comfort cooling under Section 608, 10% under Subpart C)
- Are only as accurate as the data you enter

**The App does not connect to any sensors, IoT devices, or monitoring equipment.** Leak rate "detection" in the App means calculation from your manually entered service data, not automated environmental sensing.

### 3.4 Notification Timing

The App schedules local notifications (e.g., repair deadline reminders, inspection due alerts, invoice reminders) based on time-based scheduling, **not real-time monitoring**. Notifications:

- Are scheduled using iOS `UNUserNotificationCenter` at the time you create or update records
- May be delayed by iOS power management, Do Not Disturb mode, or device restart
- Are not guaranteed to arrive at the exact scheduled time
- Should not be relied upon as your sole reminder system for EPA compliance deadlines

### 3.5 A2L Safety Checklists

A2L refrigerant safety checklists in the App are informational aids. The App tracks six mandatory safety items for A2L refrigerant service: dissipation confirmed, spark-free tools verified, ventilation verified, PPE verified, A2L-rated leak detector used, and equipment grounded. An optional seventh item — emergency plan reviewed — may also be recorded. These checklists:

- Do not replace proper safety training
- Do not replace manufacturer-specific handling guidelines
- Do not substitute for compliance with ASHRAE 34 safety classifications
- Are provided to assist your professional judgment, not to replace it

### 3.6 Verification Test Deadline Warnings

The App displays informational warnings when follow-up verification tests are recorded past the regulatory deadline window (10 days for Subpart C, 30 days for Section 608). These warnings are **informational only** and do not block test submission. They are provided to assist your awareness of regulatory timelines but do not constitute legal advice about compliance status.

### 3.7 Compliance Recommendations

Leak rate threshold comparisons, repair deadline calculations, inspection scheduling, chronic leaker detection, and all other compliance features are provided as aids to your professional judgment as a certified technician. Inspection frequency may be automatically escalated (made more frequent) when leak rates exceed regulatory thresholds, and de-escalated after four consecutive compliant quarterly inspections. These scheduling adjustments are recommendations only and do not replace your obligation to follow EPA-mandated inspection intervals. **Always verify compliance requirements with the EPA, your state regulatory agency, or a qualified compliance professional.**
